# ComputerCraft Temver Package Manager (CC-TPM)

CC-TPM is a package manager for ComputerCraft written in Lua. It is designed to simplify the distribution of packages by providing tools to host and manage repositories.

A repository is a collection of packages, hosted on GitHub or any other service that offers static file serving. To host your own repository, see [Host a TPM Repository](#HostATPMRepository).

The base package `tpm` is hosted in this repository, along with the `TPM-Default` repository. If you think that your package is an essential, you can submit it by opening a pull request against the `main` branch (see [Compose and submit a package](#ComposeAndSubmitApackage)).

If the package is intended to be submitted to the `Default TPM Repository`, some specific guidelines may apply (but these will be indicated each time).
